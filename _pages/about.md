Hello fellow blob of carbon! I'm Arsh Sharma and I'm enthusiastic about all (*well almost all*) things tech! I particularly love open source and distributed systems. 

I enjoy learning new things and writing about them in my [blogs](/tags). If you'd like to see what all I've worked on, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/RinkiyaKeDad). If you're looking to connect you'll find ways to reach me on the left side of this page :)

Fun Fact: I may not know how to invert a binary tree in O(N) but I can Google how to do that in O(1) :P
